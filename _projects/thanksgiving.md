The thanksgiving in fall 2019 inspired me to look inward at all that we have——vision, functioning limbs, and the internet, just to name a few. This game night features unique challenges that take those all away. 

As with all the game nights, I've linked a *view only* google drive folder below that contains all the pertinent information for the game. To play this, you'll need someone to **host**. As a host, you'll need to copy and tweak the main slide deck, namely adding teams and adjusting certain challenges to your group. The speaker notes should help with hosting as well. Finally, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to email sohum11@berkeley.edu!
