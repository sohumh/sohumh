**Objective:** The goal is for every player to determine their number.

**Gameplay:** 
- It is a turn based game, the youngest player starts, and turns proceed clockwise.
- Each person has a unique number between 1 and 50. You know everyone’s number *except* your own.
- The team wins if everyone successfully guesses their own number
- On a given turn, you can do as many of the below as you'd like:
    - **Guess** your own number.
        - If guessed correctly, the game continues with the remaining players.
        - As a team, if someone guesses incorrectly, you all lose.
    - **Roll** two dice and perform an arithmetic operation using the two values to change the base.
        - E.g., if the base is currently 12, and you roll a 4 and a 6, the new base can be 14 (12 + 6 - 4) for the next player
    - Give one **hint** (among a **maximum** of four previously agreed upon hints).
        - Players should meet beforehand to give meaning to each hint, e.g. “plus_one” could mean “the current value of base is 1 bigger than some player’s value”
    - **Point** to someone
- There are **two rounds** of gameplay, after which the game ends.
- Note that you can only guess your number on your turn, so earlier players may not be able to go twice…
