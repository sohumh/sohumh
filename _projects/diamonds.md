**Gameplay:**
- Use a standard deck of cards, but with all hearts removed.
- Place all the diamonds to create the diamond formation to the right.
- Note that there are only **<span style="color:black">black</span>** cards in the draw pile——2 of each number.
- Deal each player a random hand of 4 cards. Like hanabi, a player cannot see their hand, but everyone else can!
- On a given turn, and player can:
    - *Play* a card from their hand in the correct spot, e.g. playing a Jack on the Jack. Playing a card in the incorrect spot or on top of an already played card (i.e. a black card) is a strike. If 2 strikes occur, the game ends.
    - *Discard* any card from their hand. Discarding adds a clue.
    - *Clue* another player. A clue touches all cards of a given **<span style="color:blue">row</span>** or a given **<span style="color:red">column</span>**.
        - For instance, cluing **<span style="color:blue">row 2</span>** to a player with a 6, 8, Jack, and King would touch 6 and the 8.
- The game starts with **4** clues. Use hearts to keep track of the - number of clues left.
- Upon playing or discarding, take a card from the draw pile.
- After the draw pile finishes, each player gets **2 turns**. 
- Your final score is the number of correctly placed cards, giving a max score of **13**.
- As with most cooperative games, come up with a convention, i.e. a strategy the team players follow, before playing.
