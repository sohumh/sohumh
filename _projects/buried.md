The New Years to start off 2020 felt like it needed a bang, and so this quest was formed. Teams are malleable, as at the end of the day, treasure matters more than sticking to your team... right?

As with all the game nights, I've linked a *view only* google drive folder below that contains all the pertinent information for the game. To play this, you'll need someone to **host**. As a host, you'll need to copy and tweak the main slide deck, namely adding teams and adjusting certain challenges to your group. The speaker notes should help with hosting as well. Finally, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to email sohum11@berkeley.edu!
