**Objective:** Find the shared letters while *minimizing* the total number of words spoken by either player. 

**Gameplay:**

- A two player cooperative game. 
- Each player is given 12 unique random letters (scrabble tiles, or just index cards would work!) and the goal is for one person to determine the letters that are shared between them. 
    - For instance, if the letters given were:
        - Alice: **A K N E F S M R P B Z X**
        - Bob: **Q W E R T Y U I A S Z J**
    - Then, the shared letters are: **A E S R Z**
- The players can only communicate by saying words in the **english dictionary**. Note they donâ€™t necessarily have dictionaries. 
- They cannot communicate using any other means, e.g. response time, nonverbal cues, etc. 
- As with most cooperative games, come up with a convention, i.e. a strategy the team players follow, before playing.
