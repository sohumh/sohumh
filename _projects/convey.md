**Materials Needed:** A phone, or some way of writing down words/letters. Some place to draw on.

**Players:** 4 or more.

**Objective:** Split into two teams, though the game can be extended for an aribtrary number of teams. The team that wins the most rounds wins.

**Gameplay:**
- The game is composed of rounds, in which each team designates **2 conveyor**, though it can be generalized to any number
- The **conveyors** of each team will be given a set of **4 words** to **convey**, and the team that guesses their words the fastest wins. As always, the number of words can be generalized to any number as well.
- Note that we haven't explained (1) how the set of 4 words is decided and (2) what *conveying* means, so let's dive into both below:


#### Step 1. Deciding the 4 words

The 4 words can be decided in a variety of ways, and we will discuss a couple ways below, but we encourage you all to come up with your ways

##### 1a. From a song

1. Both teams collectively decide upon an **album by a music artist**, e.g. the most recent Taylor swift album.
2. Each team randomly chooses a song in that album â€” a simple random number generator should do the trick.
3. After choosing the song, the team must select **4 words in order** in the song, and send them to the conveyors on the other team. The words should be in the same phrase, and not between sentences.

##### 1b. From categories

See [hum charades](/creativity/hum_charades/) for different ways of choosing from categories.

#### Step 2. Conveying the words

4. Upon receiving the **4 words**, the conveyors have three means in which they can choose to **convey** the words:
    1. **Acting:** Use classic charades rules.
    2. **Explaining:** Verbally explaining a given word might be too easy, so we will copy the game [Poetry for Neanderthals](https://www.explodingkittens.com/products/poetry-for-neanderthals) and restrict the explainer to only using **one syllable words**
    3. **Drawing:** Use classic pictionary rules.
    - Since 4 words are given, each of the above means must be used at least once, and one can be used twice. Since there are **2 conveyors**, they will each convey two of the words, and they can decide amongst themselves which words they act, and which means they used for the word
- We recommend starting the timer right as the set of 4 words is given to the other team's conveyors, so the time the conveyors spend determining who conveys which words matters.
