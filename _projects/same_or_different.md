importance: 1

**Objective:**
In this game, you all are working together to pass as many rounds as possible.

**Gameplay:**
- Note that this game can be played with *as* many people as you'd like, but the sweet spot is anywhere between 4 - 8.
- Let's say there are 10 rounds of gameplay, though you all can play for as long as you'd like
- In each round, a category will be given with many possible answers, e.g. `Say a CS class at UC Berkeley`. Then, everyone will put their thumb up or down if, as a *group*, they want to go for sameness or uniqueness, respectively.
    - **Uniqueness:** Every player gives a unique, valid response to the prompt.
    - **Sameness:** Every player must give the same, valid response to the prompt.
- The majority vote will go through.
- Then, each player will write their answer down, or remember it by honor. If the group went for sameness, reveal at the same time. Otherwise, reveal one by one. 
    - If you want to play as honestly as possible, revealing should be the only time you talk!
- For a given round, if the uniqueness or sameness is fulfilled, then you pass the round.
- Finally, unlike most cooperative games, you don't really need a convention, i.e. a strategy the team players follow, to play this game, but if your team wants to make a rough one, feel free!
