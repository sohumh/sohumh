**Materials Needed:** A phone, or some way of writing down words/letters.

**Players:** 4 or more.

**Objective:** Split into two teams, though the game can be extended for an aribtrary number of teams. The team that wins the most rounds wins.

## Classic Version
**Gameplay:**
- The game is composed of rounds, in which each team member designates one **actor**. 
- The **actor** of each team will be given a set of words to act, and the actor that acts out her set of words the fastest wins.
- The set of words is given to an actor, as depicted in the following "handshake".  Note that the handshake is performed *twice*, for each actor.

- To clarify the visual above, observe there are two teams, Team A and Team B, with actors Avni and Bentley respectively. Lets also suppose that the teams established a set of four categories ahead of time â€” Food, Animals, Cities, and Sports. Note that this game can be easily extended to any number of teams and any number of categories.
    1. The first step in the "handshake", is that each team sends **4 letters** to the other team. These letters are in essence chosen at random, and can form a word for fun, but it doesn't really matter.
        - Team A sends the letters **P L A Y** and Team B sends **W F T H**.
    2. Next, here is where the strategic element comes in. Each team sends 4 words, where each word starts with a different letter and fits in a different category. 
        - Team A sends the words: **Pickleball** (sport), **Lamb chops** (food), **Amsterdam** (city), and **Yak** (animal). Team B sends the words: **Waterloo** (city), **Fencing** (sport), **Tortoise** (animal), and **Ham** (food). Note the phrases send don't need to be one word, but should convey one idea. 
    3. Finally, the actors must act out the set of words they are given following [charades rules](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/nau/misc/charades.html), and they are timed to complete it. The team that guesses all the words the fastest wins. 
        - We recommend starting the stopwatch right as the actor receives the words.
        - The actor cannot verbally state which category/letter she is acting
        - Note that is in both teams best interest to give the hardest possible words in step 2! Out of fairness, we play with the expectation that at least 2 members of the following team should know what the word/phrase is.
- Feel free to change the categories between rounds, here are some that we recommend, though any broad category would work just fine.
    - Food, Animals, Cities, Sports, Celebrities, Hobbies, Professions, Countries, Attire, Companies, Restaurants

## Scattergories Version
- The scattergories version works very similarly to the above, but the handshake differs:
