Fill in the empty letters such that words read horizontally 
and the path each guy takes to his matching girl spells
a word. Each guy can move in any bordering/diagonally bordering cell, and takes a path of 5 letters. 

All empty spaces will be traversed by a guy, and some guys have a word written above them that *hints* to the word their path spells. Finally, note that every guy starts at the square right below them, and ends at the square right above their matching girl.
