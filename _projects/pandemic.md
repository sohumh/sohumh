As I'm guessing was the case with you, the pandemic hit me hard. I was bored, detached from my friends, and uninspired. This game changed all that. With challenges crafted to exploit the unknown intracacies of zoom to tasks refining team chemisty, this game night has it all!  

As with all the game nights, I've linked a *view only* google drive folder below that contains all the pertinent information for the game. To play this, you'll need someone to **host**. As a host, you'll need to copy and tweak the main slide deck, namely adding teams and adjusting certain challenges to your group. This time, however, instead of just adding speaker notes, I created a full guide, which I linked below as well. Finally, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to email sohum11@berkeley.edu!
