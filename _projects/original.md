As is the case with most of the game nights I've created, they come about from a lot of boredom and a little spurt of creativity. This time, I distinctly remember that little spurt. It was earlh sophomore fall, and I was eating a clementine outside the terrace cafe in berkeley, and suddenly a weird challenge popped in my head. From that, the rest was history. 

This time, I've linked a *view only* google drive slide deck below for the game. Unlike other game nights, all the information needed is in that deck! To play this, you'll need someone to **host**. As a host, you'll need to copy and tweak the main slide deck, namely adding teams and adjusting certain challenges to your group. As usual, look at the speaker notes. Finally, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to email sohum11@berkeley.edu!
