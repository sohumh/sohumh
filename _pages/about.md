Hey! I am currently a Software Engineer at [Scale AI](https://scale.com), and I graduated UC Berkeley in 2022 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I really enjoy thinking creatively, which can be seen in the many unique puzzles I've created, the [hidden message wordsearch](sohumwordsearch.herokuapp.com) algorithm I built from scratch, or the [cooperative games](coopgames.github.io) class I created and designed at Berkeley.

In past summers, I co-instructed [CS 61BL](https://cs61bl.org/su21/staff) and interned as a Software Engineer at Intuit. Over the semesters, I spent much of my time creating teaching content for Berkeley's Data Structures and Algorithms class and playing on the Cal Men's Ultimate Frisbee team.
